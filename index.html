                <h2>Mel Bochner's</h2>
                <p>I would like to note Mel Bochners passing on February 
                12, 2025. He was a valued colleague, a brilliant 
                interlocutor, never brought less than his A game to 
                studio visits and reviews, he had a voice that brought 
                insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense 
                of humor. I was fortunate to be his colleague. Students 
                felt fortunate for the exchange they shared. He never 
                varnished his truth. May he rest in peace.</p>
