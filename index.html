                <h2>Mel Bochner's</h2>
                <p>I would like to note Mel Bochners passing on February
                    12, 2025. He was a valued colleague, a brilliant
                    interlocutor, never brought less than his A game to
                    studio visits and reviews, he had a voice that brought
                    insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense
                    of humor. I was fortunate to be his colleague. Students
                    felt fortunate for the exchange they shared. He never
                    varnished his truth. May he rest in peace.</p>
